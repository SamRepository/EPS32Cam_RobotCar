## Introduction

This repository contains the complete project for an obstacle detection system using an ESP32-CAM based robot car. It is designed to navigate through narrow paths and detect obstacles, making it ideal for urban sanitation and infrastructure maintenance.

## Features

- Real-time video streaming from ESP32-CAM
- Remote control via web application
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Data logging and reporting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP32-CAM module
- Motor driver module
- DC motors and wheels
- Power supply
- Arduino IDE
- Basic knowledge of electronics and programming

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ESP32Cam_RobotCar.git
   ```
2. Open the Arduino IDE and install the ESP32 board package.
3. Install required libraries:
   ```sh
   Arduino libraries: WiFi, ESPAsyncWebServer, AsyncTCP, etc.
   ```

## Hardware Setup

1. Assemble the robot car with the ESP32-CAM module, motor driver, and DC motors.
2. Connect the components as per the provided schematic diagram.
3. Ensure the power supply is properly connected to all components.

## Software Setup

### Microcontroller Code

1. Open `ESP32Cam_RobotCar.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Configure your WiFi credentials in the code:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
   const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";
   ```
3. Upload the code to the ESP32-CAM module.

### Web Application

1. The web application files are located in the `web_app` directory.
2. Upload these files to a server or host them locally.
3. Access the web application through the provided URL to control and monitor the robot car.

## Usage

1. Power on the robot car and ensure it connects to the WiFi network.
2. Open the web application and start controlling the robot car.
3. Monitor the video stream and navigate the robot through various environments.

## Testing

1. Test the robot car in a simulated environment with obstacles.
2. Record the performance and make necessary adjustments.
3. Validate the obstacle detection and avoidance mechanisms.

## Limitations

- Sensitivity to light variations
- Connectivity issues in certain environments
- Limited battery life

## Future Work

- Improve obstacle detection algorithms
- Enhance robustness of the system
- Expand testing to more complex environments
